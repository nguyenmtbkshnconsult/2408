                            Since the Hubble Space Telescope was launched into
                            space in 1990, astronauts have needed to complete
                            regular missions to repair the telescope and keep it
                            working smoothly. Researchers hope that robots will
                            soon be able to make these repairs. Employing robots
                            instead of humans to make repairs will be helpful,
                            as __________ astronauts to maintain the telescope
                            can be expensive.

                            In the 1940s, Evelyn Cunningham worked for the
                            Pittsburgh Courier, focusing on coverage of the
                            early civil rights movement. Cunningham's
                            accomplishment is just one example of the rich
                            history of Black journalism in the United States.
                            That history is preserved by the National
                            Association of Black Journalists, which was founded
                            in Washington, D.C. in 1975 to support Black media
                            professionals and honor people like Cunningham.

                            Why do ocelots purr but jaguars roar? Researchers
                            hypothesize that this difference between the two,
                            feline species may be partly due to a U-shaped bone
                            in their throats called the hyoid. Ocelots, which
                            are much smaller than jaguars, have a rigid hyoid
                            that rumbles when the cat's larynx vibrates,
                            resulting in a purr. By contrast, jaguars have a
                            somewhat flexible hyoid, and the bone is attached to
                            the skull with a stretchy ligament that ocelots
                            lack. These traits allow jaguars and most other
                            species of big cats to produce powerful roars. The
                            same traits may also prevent most big cats from
                            purring.

                            “Coyote” is an example of a loanword—that is, a word
                            that originated in one language and was later
                            adopted by another. The word came to English
                            indirectly from
                            <em>

                            for the wild canine species. Spanish had borrowed it
                            from Nahuatl, an Indigenous language of Central
                            Mexico, in which the word's original form is
                            <em>

                            origin and entered English through Spanish, But in
                            this case, the original source was Quechua, a
                            language of South America, in which the word for the

                            group of infants. The researchers also measured the
                            infants' heart rates, as a reduced heart rate is
                            considered a measure of relaxation. They claim that
                            the lullaby did indeed relax the infants.

                            Psychologists Gregory Bryant, Dorsa Amir, and
                            colleagues investigated cross-cultural perceptions
                            of spontaneous (real) laughter and volitional (fake
                            or forced) laughter. Study participants from 21
                            societies, including those in Austria and Turkey,
                            listened to randomized recordings of 18 spontaneous
                            laughs taken from natural conversations between
                            pairs of women and 18 volitional laughs produced
                            separately by 18 different women in response to an
                            experimenter's instruction to laugh. Analysis of the
                            participants' evaluations of the laughs prompted the
                            team to conclude that the ability to distinguish
                            between spontaneous and volitional laughter appears
                            to be universal across cultures.

                            Like all species of baleen whales, the humpback
                            whale
                            feeds on tiny creatures known as krill by filtering
                            water through bristlelike keratin structures called
                            baleen plates. In this way, baleen whales can eat up
                            to 30 percent of their total mass per day. And while
                            no one would call the humpback whale small—it can
                            have a mass as high as 30,000 kg—it is one of the
                            smaller baleen whales and is much smaller than the
                            fin whale, which can weigh a whopping 80,000 kg and
                            consume as much as 24,000 kg of krill per day.

                            Water flowing around an obstruction creates vortices
                            (patterns of swirls) of varying size; by detecting
                            the vortices, fish can determine the size and
                            position of the obstruction. Testing by Yuzo R.
                            Yanagisuru, Otar Akanyeti, and James C. Liao using
                            models of three head shapes narrow (low ratio of
                            width to length), intermediate, and wide (high ratio
                            of width to length) showed that for large vortices,
                            fish with intermediate heads would be better able
                            than wide-headed fish to distinguish between
                            vortices and general turbulence in the water. A
                            second research team has therefore hypothesized that
                            in low-visibility conditions, intermediate-headed
                            fish will be more likely than wide-headed fish to
                            detect obstructions that create large vortices.

                            week,” and coded each speaker's manual gestures.
                            Previous research has found a tendency in many
                            cultures to make temporal distinctions using spatial

                            axes (i.e., relative to the orientation of the
                            speaker): for instance, Spanish speakers often refer
                            to the left/right axis to describe events in time.

                            Over 600 languages are spoken in New York City in
                            addition to English—one can find Bambara spoken in
                            the neighborhood of Kingsbridge, for example, or
                            Ghale in Jackson Heights. English is the most
                            common, with 65% of New Yorkers speaking it at home;
                            Spanish is second, at 20%. A linguist hypothesizes
                            that a Spanish dialect—a variation differing from
                            the parent language in some of its vocabulary,
                            pronunciation, and grammar—has developed in New York
                            City, partly due to its linguistic interaction with
                            English. Previous research shows that younger
                            speakers of nonmajority languages are more likely to
                            borrow words from the majority language of a region
                            than are older speakers. If the linguist's
                            hypothesis is correct, it is therefore likely to be

                            An analysis by Alain Elayi and colleagues of coins
                            minted in Sidon in the fifth and fourth centuries
                            BCE reveals a change in their composition overtime:
                            while a coin from circa 450 BCE contains about 98%
                            silver and 1% copper, a coin from 367 BCE (the end
                            of Ba'alsillem II's reign) contains 74.2% silver and
                            24.7% copper, giving it a relatively yellowish
                            appearance that traders would have noticed. Because
                            coins with a silver content below 80% were widely
                            considered unsuitable for trade, Elayi
                            <em>
                                et

                            speculate that a crisis in confidence
                            in the currency occurred in Sidon around 367 BCE,
                            which was likely relieved- despite Sidon's
                            persistent oppressive financial obligations- as a

                            Today, the Michelin Guide is widely known as the
                            arbiter of fine dining, but when it was created in
                            1900, it was little more than a marketing gimmick;
                            brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin sought to
                            increase profits for their tire company by
                            encouraging their customers to drive across France,
                            visiting the guide's recommended hotels and
                            restaurants along the way. Nevertheless, the guide
                            soon grew in scope and __________ its modest French
                            eateries were replaced with some of the most
                            esteemed restaurants from around the world,
                            including La Yeon in Seoul and Sushi Shikon in Hong

                            engaged in a famous debate; Bohr's argument, later
                            called, the Copenhagen interpretation, would remain
                            popular decades after.

                            Building additional road capacity may seem like an
                            obvious solution to traffic congestion, but numerous

                            heart.

                            In 2023 literary scholar Jeremy Douglass cautioned
                            technology investors and enthusiasts who predict
                            conventional books' ultimate displacement by newer
                            forms of media. Douglass observed that the concept
                            of an "interactive" text is much older than
                            technologists assume,
                            <u>
                                extending back to the first
                                time readers scratched notes into a text's
                                margins
                            </u>
                            . In addition, newer media, such as
                            video games, haven't replaced older forms of
                            entertainment, such as comic books, but rather exist
                            alongside them. Douglass believes that rather than
                            supplanting books, technology is simply making new
                            forms of expression possible.

                            Businesses selling clothing and other fashion items
                            face obstacles in trying to forecast how much
                            product to order: tastes and styles change quickly,
                            while manufacturing clothing takes a significant
                            amount of time. Researchers Youran Fu and Marshall
                            Fisher have found that combining sellers' own data
                            with information gathered from social media can
                            dramatically improve the accuracy of such forecasts
                            by 24 to 57 percent in the cases they directly
                            studied. Better predictions mean demand is easier to
                            meet without retailers becoming overstocked.

                            storage. Hopper was a US naval admiral and computer
                            scientist who coined the term "debugging" and
                            invented the first compiler program for translating
                            computer code. In this way, Hopper and others like
                            her helped make it possible for more women-such as
                            Anna Lysyanskaya, who currently works in and teaches

                                Dog)

                        <blockquote>
                            The narrator and two friends are taking a
                            boat down the River Thames in England. In a boat, I
                            have always noticed that it is the fixed idea of
                            each member of the crew that he is doing everything.
                            Harris's notion was, that it was he alone who had
                            been working, and that both George and I had been
                            imposing upon him. George, on the other hand,
                            ridiculed the idea of Harris's having done anything
                            more than eat and sleep, and had a cast- iron
                            opinion that it was he-George himself-who had done
                            all the labour worth speaking of.

                            Sociologist Todd Gitlin co-opted the term
                            "recombinant," normally used in reference to genetic
                            engineering, to describe serialized television shows
                            of the 1980s. Gitlin's use of the term referenced TV
                            studios' practice of repackaging successful
                            narrative formulas as new __________ even shows that
                            varied only slightly from other shows still

                            In her 2012 analysis of tree rings from Japan's Yaku
                            Island, cosmic ray physicist Fusa Miyake noted an
                            anomalous carbon-14 spike dating to 774- 775 CE,
                            indicating that a massive burst of radiation reached
                            Earth during that time. __________ this
                            unprecedented radiocarbon surge was dubbed a
                            "Miyake event" in honor of its discoverer.

                            poet] was no surprise to her, but matter for
                            satisfaction, until, as the years wore on, certain

                            lands but an example of intellectual virtue; perhaps
                            the conclusiveness of a great ancestor is a little
                            discouraging to those who run the risk of comparison
                            with him.

                            Kelp forests grow underwater along the eastern
                            Pacific Coast. These underwater forests are
                            important to fish and other marine animals. Ocean
                            currents can be powerful and rough, making it
                            difficult for animals to find safe places to hide
                            from predators. The underwater forests slow down the
                            currents. This creates a more __________ environment
                            with calmer waters where animals can take
                            shelter.

                            Pteropods are small swimming snails with thin,
                            delicate calcium carbonate shells. These animals are
                            thought to be especially vulnerable to ocean
                            acidification due to calcium carbonate's
                            susceptibility to dissolution at lower pH values.
                            Victoria L. Peck and colleagues recently found that
                            the periostracum (a protective coating on pteropods'
                            outer shells) prevents this dissolution when intact.
                            Moreover, the team was surprised to discover that
                            even when the periostracum is breached, pteropods
                            can still mitigate damage by rebuilding the inner
                            shell wall.

                            San Francisco has high pedestrian traffic, but
                            simply
                            replicating a feature of San Francisco associated
                            with walkability e.g., its high density of
                            storefronts—may be insufficient to induce increased
                            walking in other cities. As urbanist Mariela Alfonzo
                            argues, our understanding of individuals'
                            decision-making about whether to walk is
                            insufficiently robust: some studies emphasize the
                            role of demographic characteristics, others the role
                            of public transit availability, and so on, but
                            walking decisions are made in complex contexts in
                            which multiple conditions and needs inform
                            individuals' choices.

                            focusing on sightings of these species in the

                            and the mesophotic zone (30 to 150 meters below the
                            surface). Consulting the table, she notes that the
                            smallest maximum depth is located in __________

                            United States in the 1990s was present both in very
                            large cities such as Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and
                            smaller areas such as Albany-Schenectady-Troy, New
                            York, and Beaumont, Texas; though those smaller
                            areas may have been less affected by traffic
                            congestion than very large cities, this congestion
                            also worsened in them over time.

                            Past research suggests that pollination by honeybees
                            is responsible for up to 10 percent of total Chinese
                            cabbage crop production. Now researchers are trying
                            to determine how dependent cucumber crop production
                            is on honeybees. The first phase of their study
                            involved shielding some cucumber plants to prevent
                            insects from pollinating them, resulting in those
                            plants having 40 to 90 percent lower crop production
                            than plants that were pollinated normally. However,
                            the researchers claim that the first-phase
                            experiment alone didn't tell them how much of that
                            difference in crop production is due specifically to
                            excluding honeybees.

                            Released in 1993, the intel Pentium microchip
                            contained a single CPU, or core, to execute
                            commands. Since then, the average processing power
                            of microchips has increased so drastically—cores now
                            number in the dozens, hundreds, or even __________
                            the once-revolutionary dual-core technology that
                            replaced the single-core chip can be found in
                            everyday items like toasters and toothbrushes.

                            There are three basic steps you should follow when
                            planning a scientific inquiry. First, thoroughly
                            research the question you wish to answer. __________
                            come up with a prediction (also called a hypothesis)
                            about the answer to your question. Third, develop an
                            experiment that can test the accuracy of your
                            hypothesis.

                            While researching a topic, a student has taken the
                            following notes:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Onomatopoeias are words that imitate the sounds
                                they represent.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Words that represent the same sound are often
                                written and pronounced very differently from
                                language to language.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                This variation is due in part to differences in
                                how the languages are structured.
                            </li>

                                "Korrrr" is a Batak onomatopoeia that represents
                                the sound of snoring.
                            </li>

                                "Hu lu" is a Mandarin Chinese onomatopoeia that
                                represents the sound of snoring.

                                The student wants to contrast two words that
                                represent the same sound. Which choice most
                                effectively uses relevant information from the
                                notes to accomplish this goal?

                            Writer Lydia Davis observed that while __________
                            literary forms, such as the short story, are
                            recognizable as such even as they evolve, there are
                            rarer "intergeneric" forms that might, for example,
                            use elements of both fiction and essays to create
                            something unclassifiable. Anne Carson's collection
                            <em>
                                Float
                            </em>
                            arguably fits in this category, since
                            it straddles the line between prose and poetry.

                            President Richard Nixon is most famous for his
                            participation in the 1970s Watergate political
                            scandal, a convoluted tale of criminality and eroded
                            ethics involving a constellation of associates such
                            as political operative Jeb Stuart Magruder and
                            Nixon's secretary Rose Mary Woods. But Nixon's
                            legacy is complex: he has been praised for his role
                            in affirming the sovereignty of tribal nations, and
                            he once made an attempt at reforming United States
                            health care policy that is arguably a precursor to
                            the Affordable Care Act, which became law during the
                            Barack Obama administration.

                            . The narrator and two friends are
                            taking a boat down the River Thames in England.

                        <blockquote>
                            In a boat, i have always noticed that it is
                            the fixed idea of each member of the crew that he is
                            doing everything. Harris's notion was, that it was
                            he alone who had been working, and that both George
                            and I had been imposing upon him. George, on the
                            other hand, ridiculed the idea of Harris's having
                            done anything more than eat and sleep, and had a
                            cast-iron opinion that it was he—George himself—who
                            had done all the labour worth speaking
                            of.

                            The poet Audre Lorde once claimed that poetry is the
                            most inexpensive of art forms to practice. While
                            people who pursue other art forms—painting,
                            architecture, theater—require large blocks of
                            uninterrupted time as well as money to complete
                            their work, poets can write, as Lorde said,
                            "between shifts, in the hospital pantry, on the subway, and on scraps of surplus paper."
                            So poets can practice their art even if they must
                            earn their living in another way.

                            field. While it is possible in theory for anyone to

                            Water flowing around an obstruction creates vortices
                            (swirls) that vary in size with the obstruction's
                            size and position, and fish sense these vortices in
                            order to navigate around the obstructions, Using
                            models of three fish-head shapes—narrow (low ratio
                            of width to length), intermediate, and wide (high
                            ratio of width to length)—Yuzo R. Yanagisuru, Otar

                            size increases, pressure fluctuations at the snout

                            visibility, a fish will be more likely to avoid an
                            obstruction when the associated pressure
                            fluctuations at the fish's snout are greater.

The x-axis shows days after infection from 0 to 10. There are three lines: type A flies (solid with squares), type AB flies (dashed with triangles), and type B flies (dotted with circles). All start at 100%. Type B drops to near 0% by day 6. Type A and AB drop more slowly, with type A slightly higher than AB, ending around 30-40% survival at day 10."

                            that they didn't resemble human speech. Each dog was
                            familiar with either Spanish or Hungarian, but not
                            both. The team concluded that the amount of previous
                            language exposure a dog has received may influence
                            its ability to distinguish familiar languages from
                            unfamiliar ones.

                            Manchester United Football club won more than half
                            its home matches between 1947 and 2003, helping to
                            distinguish the team as a top British professional
                            soccer club, Additionally, Manchester United, whose
                            home uniform color is mainly red, was more
                            successful in home matches than was Coventry City
                            Football club, whose home uniform color is not red.
                            Research has shown that many people associate the
                            color red with power and dominance. Past experiences

                            people to respond to the color red with caution and
                            hesitation. These findings, if applicable in the
                            context of athletic competitions, could suggest that

                            Bentley examined research on white-throated sparrows

                            Lab studies are useful because they make it easy to
                            control important variables, but white-throated
                            sparrows' surroundings can significantly affect
                            their hormone levels. Therefore, it's not altogether
                            surprising that when Calisi-Rodriguez and Bentley

                            Exclusively inhabiting tropical countries such as
                            Liberia, wild chimpanzees lack adaptations to
                            seasonal variations in ultraviolet B (UVB)
                            irradiance from sunlight; since UVB exposure enables
                            vertebrates to synthesize vitamin D, this raises
                            questions about how chimpanzees in mid-latitude zoos
                            are affected by the lower and more variable UVB
                            irradiance in those locations. In a study of zoo

                            countries, Sophie Moittié and colleagues found not
                            only that chimpanzees' vitamin D levels correlate
                            with UVB irradiance but also that vitamin D levels
                            show no evidence of plateauing as UVB irradiance

                            With some elements, like phosphorus, scientists were
                            able to isolate a relatively pure sample of the
                            substance shortly after discovering its existence
                            but this wasn't the case with all elements,
                            __________ the isolation process took a few years.
                            The element molybdenum, for instance, was discovered
                            in 1778 but not isolated until 1781.

                            Asimov is critiqued for his style, but it is wrong
                            to

                            intended to do. For example, although most of his
                            novel

                            little about his characters' lives, Asimov wanted to
                            convey the vast sweep of human history over
                            centuries, and one of his points is that at such a
                            timescale, individuals don't matter. Thus his lack
                            of characterization is central to his thematic
                            aims.

                            Animals use many objects as tools to achieve goals
                            more easily. Such goals include grooming, finding
                            food, and protecting themselves. For a long time,
                            people thought tool use was unique to primates. Sea
                            otters and other animals, though, have busted the
                            myth that tool use is limited to certain primates.
                            Inventively, sea otters use stationary anvil stones
                            to break open mollusk shells. Woodpecker finches
                            also get creative. They use cactus spines to pry
                            insects from hiding places.

                            cataracts in old age. The students compared
                            wild-type mice and knockout mice, which are mice
                            with specific genes deactivated, when mice of each

                            environments and periodically tested for cataracts.

                            Narwhals are shy whales that live in the remote
                            Arctic Ocean. Some of them have a long tusk, like a
                            unicorn horn, with sensitive nerves. Narwhals are
                            known for this tusk, but many actually don't have
                            one and its purpose is unknown. One group of
                            scientists came up with a possible purpose in 2014.
                            The scientists suggested that the tusk may help
                            narwhals determine when water around them is likely
                            to start freezing and become dangerous for them.
                            Marine biologist Kristin Laidre disagrees with that
                            idea, though. She reasons that if the narwhal's tusk
                            serves such an important purpose, then it's most
                            likely that __________

                            When Anglo and African Americans moved West in the
                            nineteenth century to begin cattle ranching, they
                            learned the trade from Spanish-speaking Mexican
                            vaqueros (cowboys). This is why many ranching terms
                            come from __________ English word “lasso” (a rope)
                            comes from the Spanish word lazo, and “cinch” (a

                            are
                            enormous collections of electronically stored texts

                            written English. For instance, one might have a
                            guess about the incidence of the word “long,” but
                            only an analysis of a corpus can prove that "long"
                            is the fifth most commonly used adjective.

                            </em>
                            is a 2001 novel by Ojibwe writer
                            Louise Erdrich: it explores how historical events
                            affect families on a reservation in rural North
                            Dakota. The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No
                            Horse is typical of Erdrich's work. Her writing
                            usually focuses on portrayals of everyday life in
                            Ojibwe communities. Yet some of her novels have
                            fantastical plots and take place outside Ojibwe
                            communities.

                            of fungal strands in the soil. Meding and Zasoski
                            excluded all pathways other than the CMN by using
                            barriers to keep the plants' root systems separate
                            while allowing mycorrhizal strands through—a crucial

                            excluding root-to-root transmission). However, any
                            barrier used must allow the thread-like hyphae of a
                            CMN to pass through, and this permeability would
                            also allow liquids through. Thus, the researchers'
                            experimental design cannot ensure that any nutrient
                            transfer observed can be attributed to a CMN and not
                            to some other pathway.

                            The food industry has long used thermal technologies

                            through research in Mexico on the preservation of
                            wheat flour. Radiofrequency heating is generally
                            considered to be an improvement over more
                            conventional thermal preservation methods: whereas
                            conventional methods transfer energy from the
                            surface of a food to its interior, radiofrequency
                            heating uses precisely controlled radio waves to
                            generate heat within the food itself, thus reducing
                            industrial cooking times.

                            reproductively separate lineages—can result from a
                            genetic mechanism shared by both lineages.
                            Meanwhile, Patricia J. Wittkopp and colleagues have
                            investigated how convergence occurs through
                            different genetic mechanisms. However, the relative

                            different genetic processes is still poorly

                            year ahead), while half of those who make a
                            resolution make more than one. The survey asked
                            participants what kinds of resolutions they made and
                            separated them into several categories. The table
                            presents percentages of people who make particular
                            kinds of New Year's resolutions among those who
                            choose to make them, indexed by age bracket.

                            Male orangutans typically disperse from the
                            territory
                            in which they were born when they reach maturity,
                            whereas females typically do not. Beatrice Ehmann
                            and her colleagues showed that this difference in
                            life trajectory is reflected in the diets of
                            immature orangutans, with females' diets overlapping
                            more with their mothers' diets than males' diets do.
                            For example, on average, individual 9's mother

                            Many films in a language other than English grow to
                            be financially successful over the course of their
                            time in movie theaters in the United States, but
                            some become immediate successes in their opening
                            weekends. A journalist claims that a film's
                            reception can greatly influence its long-term
                            success. Indications that the film is of high
                            quality, such as an Oscar nomination, can
                            dramatically boost public interest in the film and
                            thus its overall earnings, even with a relatively
                            modest opening weekend performance: for example,

                            Zooarchaeologist Ophélie Lebrasseur and her team
                            examined a fox skeleton discovered in 1991 at an
                            archaeological site alongside artifacts of human
                            habitation (like spear points) in central Argentina.
                            Lebrasseur et al. determined that the fox was

                            resembling a jackal, and radiocarbon dating placed
                            the fox at the site at the same time as human
                            inhabitants. (Indeed, the inhabitants may have
                            deliberately buried the fox.) In addition, while
                            wild foxes have a diet entirely made of meat,
                            isotopic signatures of the skeleton's teeth
                            indicated that the fox's diet, like that of the
                            humans, was partly composed of plant material.
                            Lebrasseur et al. therefore concluded that

                            Prolonged exposure to anthropogenic noise (sounds
                            from human sources like traffic or mining) can
                            affect animals, as Graeme Shannon and colleagues
                            found in a 2014 study of black-tailed prairie dogs.
                            Researchers conducted a meta-analysis of studies of
                            how such noise affects animals and found that, for
                            every study, relevant traits or behaviors of the
                            animals were observably different between the
                            exposed group and the otherwise similar but
                            unexposed group. Although, on average, studies of
                            mammals showed larger differences than studies of
                            fish did, for every class of animals examined, there
                            were individual studies showing differences well
                            above the average for mammals. Therefore, the
                            results of the meta-analysis suggest that

                            couldn't agree on a single-width system. Thus,
                            railways in Queensland, like the Durundur Railway,
                            were made using narrow tracks, while those in
                            Victoria were built with wide tracks.

                            from earlier in the century rose dramatically, which
                            had the counterintuitive effect of __________

                            stamps could be resold later at a profit.

                            supplied. In fact, some species actually did better
                            in Martian soil than in Earth soil: 30 percent of
                            field mustard seeds sprouted when planted in
                            simulated Martian soil, compared with 4 percent that
                            did when planted in soil from their home planet.

                            The following text is from Mick Herron's 2023 novel

                                Winston Day, whose features seemed moulded to
                                adorn a bust, or possibly a stamp, and whose
                                forehead was so evidently bulging with grey
                                matter that it would have been impertinent to
                                inquire too closely into the actual achievements
                                his half century of public service had produced.
                                His recently published memoirs possibly cast
                                light on this enigma, but given that such
                                details were not provided until after the

                            Many Indian snack foods, such as bhatoora and
                            pakora,
                            acquire their flavor from being fried in oil; some
                            are also coated in batter beforehand. Chemists Marc
                            A. Meyers and Andrew Grazela studied the mass and
                            heat transfer processes that occur when foods are
                            fried in batters containing hydrocolloids, polymers
                            that become viscous or gel-like in water. During
                            frying, water in the food evaporates, leaving voids
                            that oil (a pure fat) can fill. As the process
                            continues, water from the food's center moves to the
                            crust as long as the crust remains permeable.
                            However, hydrocolloids can create structures in the
                            crust that reduce the transfer of moisture out of
                            the food's core during frying. Therefore, a food
                            fried without a hydrocolloid batter coating will

                            Liverpool Football Club won more than half its home
                            matches between 1947 and 2003, helping to
                            distinguish the team as a top British professional
                            soccer club. Additionally, Liverpool, whose home
                            uniform color is mainly red, was more successful in
                            home matches than was Watford Football Club, whose
                            home uniform color is not red. Research has shown
                            that many people associate the color red with power
                            and dominance. Past experiences with red objects
                            such as stop signs can even cause people to respond
                            to the color red with caution and hesitation. These
                            findings, if applicable in the context of athletic
                            competitions, could suggest that in matches played
                            at Liverpool's home stadium, opponents may have

                            India has classified the spiraling whitefly as an
                            invasive species that could harm some of the
                            country's native species. But researchers Alejandro
                            Camacho and Jason McLachlan have pointed out that
                            “invasive” and “native” are labels that describe
                            temporary circumstances. Changes in Earth's climate
                            may force animals from their current ranges. Climate
                            changes may also create good habitats in areas where
                            a species couldn't live previously. In the case of
                            India, these observations suggest that

                            Firefly luciferase (Fluc) is a distinctly evolved

                            When people think of dinosaurs with feathers, they
                            typically think of winged dinosaurs,

                            </u>
                            . However, many dinosaurs that
                            didn't have wings also had feathers on their bodies.
                            For instance, research indicates that the wingless,
                            peacock-sized Caudipteryx likely had feathers.

                            in a given neighborhood. The team used data from the
                            Google Places API service to help identify hotels,
                            supermarkets, and other businesses and map their
                            locations. This approach has some limits—data from
                            Places API tend to be restricted to places that are
                            customer facing—but the data set nonetheless

                            occurs naturally only in the state of Tamaulipas in
                            Mexico, and the smallness of its range makes it
                            especially vulnerable to extinction. The traditional
                            single-species approach to conservation emphasizes
                            the need to focus on individual species most at
                            risk, like

                            conservationists have argued that an ecosystem-based
                            approach that incorporates the many interactions
                            between the climate, terrain, and various species of
                            a given geographical area may lead to better
                            outcomes for all the species in a given location. If
                            this view is correct, the single-species approach to

                            Some robots such as Salvius (developed in 2008) and
                            REEM-C (developed in 2013) feature humanoid
                            characteristics like bipedal locomotion so that
                            people will find it easier to interact with them.
                            While these features can help to _______ feelings of
                            comfort in people, a robot that looks too human can
                            fall into the "uncanny valley," meaning that its
                            appearance unintentionally unsettles those who
                            encounter it.

                            There are many famous examples of election pollsters
                            making inaccurate predictions in presidential
                            elections. But neuroscientist and election pollster
                            Sam Wang has said that these prediction failures
                            should not lead campaigns to __________ election
                            polling
                            entirely. Polling is about more than just predicting
                            the winner; throughout campaigns, it helps
                            strategists identify where their efforts are most
                            likely to be effective.

                            In 2011 Brynn M. Devine and colleagues published a
                            study concluding that ocean acidification has a
                            strong effect on the behavior of
                            <em>
                                Cheilodipterus

                            , a species of fish.
                            However, Devine and colleagues' study relied on a
                            mean sample size of only about 25 fish. In a 2022
                            review of various scientists' conclusions about the
                            impacts of ocean acidification on fish behavior,
                            Timothy D. Clark and colleagues caution that relying
                            on such a relatively small sample size can increase
                            the potential for biased analysis. Such analysis, in
                            turn, can contribute to reports of exaggerated
                            effects.

                            Optimal foraging theory (OFT) holds that animals'
                            foraging behaviors reflect cost-benefit trade-offs
                            that vary by species and with dynamic ecological
                            circumstances. One such circumstance is lunar
                            intensity, which Nathan Upham and John Hafner found
                            to be negatively associated with foraging by desert
                            kangaroo rats but Eduardo Fernández-Duque and
                            colleagues found to be positively associated with
                            foraging by Azara's night monkeys. This discrepancy
                            is explicable in terms of OFT: the monkeys' greater
                            reliance on vision means that higher lunar intensity
                            benefits them more than it benefits the kangaroo
                            rats.

                            Like many other genera of wild bees, bumblebees have
                            in recent decades experienced population collapse
                            caused by, among other factors, habitat destruction
                            and climate variation. Bumblebees are also one of
                            the most researched bee genera, second only to
                            honeybees. As a result, ecologists have gained much
                            of their insight about wild-bee declines from
                            bumblebees. In a 2021 paper, zoologist Guillaume
                            Ghisbain notes that bumblebees are among the
                            relatively few wild-bee genera that display social
                            behaviors and dietary generalism (ability to obtain
                            nectar and pollen from a diversity of plant
                            species), two traits that are associated with
                            increased resilience to some specific environmental
                            changes. Ghisbain therefore contends that ______

                            although bumblebees have been

                            researchers should not use bumblebees to draw
                            conclusions about the decline of other wild bees,

                            because bumblebees and other

                            threats are not always comparable, researchers need
                            to exercise caution when extrapolating information

                            by French philosopher Michel de Montaigne, suggests
                            a straightforward topic. However, Montaigne's
                            expansive, curious mind meant that he never limited
                            himself to one subject. __________ the essay is not
                            just
                            a discussion of inequality but a broad exploration
                            of Montaigne's entire worldview.

                            Writer Lydia Davis observed that while traditional
                            literary forms, such as the novel, are recognizable
                            as such even as they evolve, there are more
                            __________ forms that might, for example, borrow
                            elements from both fables and realist narratives to
                            make something unconventional. The late-period
                            pieces of James Tate arguably fit in this category,
                            since they straddle the line between prose and
                            poetry.

                            According to historical documents, Marietta
                            Strozzi—a
                            young woman who was prominent in fifteenth century
                            Florentine culture—inspired several artworks,
                            including a portrait bust sculpted by Desiderio da
                            Settignano. Multiple sculptures dating to the period
                            have been alleged to be the reported bust, but none
                            have been authenticated as Desiderio's depiction of
                            Strozzi. Given the historical importance of both
                            Strozzi and Desiderio's sculpture of her, positively
                            identifying the bust would be a notable

                            When people think of dinosaurs with feathers, they
                            typically think of winged dinosaurs, such as the bat

                            . However, many dinosaurs that
                            didn't have wings also had feathers on their bodies.
                            For instance, research indicates that the wingless,
                            predatory

                            questions is obviously no, but researchers in the
                            Netherlands recently showed that the seeds of many
                            common plant species can germinate in soil designed
                            to simulate Martian conditions, as long as water is
                            supplied. In fact, some species actually did better
                            in Martian soil than in Earth soil: 30 percent of
                            field mustard seeds sprouted when planted in
                            simulated Martian soil, compared with 4 percent that
                            did when planted in soil from their home planet.

                            entrance of the ruins of the ancient city of
                            Persepolis.

                                "The Gate of All Nations," Sohrab said. He
                                gestured to the lamassus [sculptures] and
                                pillars surrounding us.
                                "That's the name in English."

                            <p>
                                It wasn't much of a gate anymore, since anyone
                                of
                                any nation could have easily stepped around it
                                instead of walking through. But it was still
                                amazing.
                            </p>

                                Behind the lamassu, more columns sprouted from
                                the ground like ancient trees in a petrified
                                forest, forty feet tall, spindly but still
                                miraculously upright. Giant stone slabs formed
                                the remains of what must once have been a
                                breathtaking structure.

                            Michelle Pereira et al. hypothesized that
                            introducing
                            health improvements into workplaces would increase
                            productivity by reducing absenteeism (sick employees
                            not working) and presenteeism (sick workers working
                            less productively due to illness). Pereira's team
                            enrolled groups of Australian workers in two
                            programs: one that gave employees exercise training
                            (EET) and one that enrolled employees in health
                            promotion seminars (EHP). They then calculated the
                            productivity loss of those groups at 12 weeks and 12
                            months after the programs began (based on the 28
                            days preceding each point). They concluded that
                            exercise training was more effective at restraining
                            productivity loss than health promotion seminars
                            were, though this result took time to become
                            apparent.

                            area of their birth upon maturity and females do
                            not, Beatrice Ehmann and her colleagues hypothesized
                            that it is more advantageous for immature males than
                            females to devote attention to orangutans who are
                            immigrants to the home region of the immature
                            individual, and this should be reflected in
                            sex-specific differences in peering behavior.

                            British professional soccer team Arsenal Football
                            Club, whose home uniform color is mainly red, won
                            more than half its home matches between 1947 and
                            2003. This is a higher proportion than the
                            proportion of home matches won by Watford Football
                            Club, whose home uniform color is not red, during
                            the same period. According to a study by Martin J.
                            Attrill and colleagues, the color red can cause
                            people to respond with fear and hesitation, which
                            the researchers think helps explain Arsenal's
                            success. Nadav Goldschmied and colleagues reanalyzed
                            the published data from this study, however, and
                            found no evidence that red-uniformed teams are more
                            likely than other teams to win, suggesting that
                            Watford's home-match win percentage __________

                            Studies have shown that when we listen to high-tempo

                            an increased pace and a higher heart rate.
                            Researchers recently designed a follow-up study in
                            which participants jogged outdoors for 30 minutes
                            while listening to Aerosmith's "Livin' on the Edge"
                            (169 bpm) continuously. The next day participants
                            performed the same activity while listening to
                            Beyonce's "Irreplaceable" (88 bpm). As expected,
